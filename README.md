## MongoDB Atlas 
This M0 cluster cannot be resumed because the MongoDB version of its backup snapshot is too old. See Pause, Resume, or Terminate a Cluster for more details. You can terminate the paused M0 cluster and create a new M0 cluster at any time. Please contact support if you have further questions.
